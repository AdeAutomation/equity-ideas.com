        <h1>Equipping yourself with local market information is a good way to start trading stocks in the Nigerian stock
            market</h1>
        <p> The Nigerian stock market has grown over the years and has cemented its place as Africa's most rewarding
            stock market and one of the world&apos;s best-performing. With over 160 listed companies on the Nigerian Stock Exchange, it&apos;s the market of
            choice for local and foreign investors looking to amass wealth.</p><br>


        <p> There is no better time to consider making money from the Nigerian stock market. The market&apos;s participation process has been largely simplified
            in recent years by the regulatory authorities, making it more attractive to potential investors. This is a good time to get involved. For those
            that are underrating the country, Nigeria, think again. Her capital market is head and shoulders above other sectors of her economy and it has become the  most critical index for measuring her economic performance. </p>&nbsp;

        <p> The market is no longer for the rich alone. With very little amount of money, you can also get started. The market has been fully digitised, meaning that from anywhere you are located, you can trade online, with stockbrokers being more transparent and resourceful that ever before. If you like some guidance on how to get started, we can provide you with cutting-edge information for choosing and registering with a stockbroker, opening a bank account remotely, selecting stocks, online trading, share transfer, tips on managing your portfolio,  maximising your dividends and so on </p>
