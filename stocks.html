        <br>

        <p> As investors, we all anticipate the receipt of dividends from our investments. When the dividends are eventually declared, many investors are not aware of such declarations. This often results in the purchase or sale of stocks at the wrong times. Knowing dividend payment dates can help you better manage your earnings and organise your portfolio.</p><br>

        <p> On this page, you will find dividend information. As companies declare divididends, the page will be updated. If you have e-dividend mandate set up for a stock, the dividend will be paid directly to your bank account. If you do not have a mandate, contact the registrar to set this up for you. </p><br>
