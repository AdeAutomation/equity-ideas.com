        <p>The Nigerian stock market has potentials and has proven to be a haven for investors—both local and foreign. Being able to identify stocks that will
            deliver returns in as short a time as possible is key to a healthy portfolio, especially in a volatile market.
        </p><br>

        <p>One classification that is quite common when distinguishing types of stocks is the growth and value stocks classification. These two stock types are
            critical in ensuring that as an investor, you find good bargains and enjoy decent returns on your investments. But what exactly are growth and value
            stocks and where does the difference lie?</p><br>

        <p>Growth and value stocks investing are modern portfolio selection strategies and behavioural theories that could be deployed by investors to maximize
            returns and minimize risks in the stock market.</p><br>

        <p>Growth stocks are stocks that are still growing but have the potentials to deliver great returns in the future or outperform the market. These stocks
            are in the early phases of business, but showing promising signs to be future winners. In Nigeria, growth stocks typically deliver double-digit
            revenue growth yearly and it’s irrelevant if they report profits or not. In fact, most growth stocks are expected to report losses because it is
            expected that they spend a lot more on marketing, advertising and any activity that is required to strengthen their business operations.</p><br>

        <p>Where does it come from?
            Growth companies are considered to have a good chance for considerable expansion over the next few years, either because they have a product or a
            brand that is projected to sell well or because they appear to be managed better than many of their competitors and are thus predicted to gain
            comparative advantage over them.</p><br>

        <p>Where does it come from?
            The returns on growth stocks are usually through capital appreciation, rather than from dividends. This is because the underlying companies mostly
            prefer to reinvest retained profits in ongoing or new capital projects. This is a key attribute of growth stocks—albeit dividends are sometimes paid
            to shareholders, it’s not a common occurrence.</p><br>

        <p>In the Nigerian Stock Exchange growth stocks are mostly found in the technology sector. Many investors usually wrongly interpret growth stocks as
            stocks that attract high valuation despite not having any performance history. Growth stocks are seen as high quality stocks whose earnings are
            expected to continue growing. In general, the stocks have high Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios and high Price-to-book ratios, and are sometimes seen
            as expensive and overvalued.</p><br>

        <p>Value stocks on the other hand are stable, less risky and well-established companies that are trading below the what they are believed to be worth
            and show strong fundamentals—deliver moderate but steady revenue growth, profits and pay regular dividends. Value stocks are undervalued, and are
            out of favour with the market due to poor operating results or slowing growth. A value stock is cheap relative to some measure of its intrinsic
            value.</p><br>

        <p>Value stocks tend to trade at a lower price relative to their fundamentals (including dividends, earnings, and sales). Due to value stocks having low
            (P/E) ratio, they are often seen as bargain stocks by investors who buy them in the hope that they will soon rebound to reclaim their true value.
            When this happens, the share price of these stocks start to rise relative to new information pertaining to their profits or dividend
            announcements.</p><br>

        <p>Value stocks are companies that are undervalued, and are out of favour with the market due to poor operating results or slowing growth. A value stock
            is cheap relative to some measure of its intrinsic value.</p><br>

        </div>


        <p>In the Nigeria stock market, in recent years, some stocks, have traded at price earnings ratio that is below three times their earnings. Investors
            feared that the stocks might deliver losses on the back of a poor economy; and as a result assigned low earnings multiple to their valuation.
            However, as results trickled in, they showed record profits instead of declines, making investors to realise that the stocks were worth a lot more
            than they appeared. Value investors are expected to have acquired shares in the stock because they know that their fundamentals are strong and they
            will be rewarded bountifully in the future.</p><br>

        <p>Sometimes, value stocks may have prices that are below the stocks historic levels or may be associated with new companies that aren’t recognized by
            investors. They may also have been affected by a problem that raises some concerns about their long-term prospects—such as recently poor operating
            results and negative outlook. Due to the sombre nature and negative outlook of these stocks, investors overreact and value them lower than they
            should be.</p><br>

        <p>To maximise returns in the NSE, investors should endeavour to buy cheap value stocks that sell below or close to their intrinsic value.
        </p><br>

        <p>Before the introduction of investors' and exporters' window by the Central Bank of Nigeria, the stock market assigned very low price earnings
            multiple to stocks, even though there were visible signs that the economy was turning around. Vigilant value-stock investors see these signs and
            quickly buy the stocks. Value Stocks usually have low P/E ratios and low Price/book ratios.</p><br>

        <p>The difference between growth and value stocks lies mainly in the way they are perceived by the market—the investors. Growth stocks, are preferred by
            the wealthy investors. Such stocks usually exhibit sustained and rapid growth in revenues, highly-priced stocks, higher PE ratio, price to book and
            low dividend yield than the value stocks. On the other hand, value stocks are unwanted lowly priced stocks, such stocks have higher dividend yield
            but with disappointing earnings, lower price to book ratio and PE ratio amongst other disappointing financial fundamentals. Value stocks are sought
            after by the patient investors and growth stocks are demanded by impatient investors.</p><br>

        <p>There could be rotational benefits between the growth and the value portfolio, as growth and value investments tend to run in cycles. Understanding
            the differences between them may help you decide which may be appropriate, helping you achieve your specific goals. Irrespective of which type of
            investor you are, there may be a place for both growth and value stocks in your portfolio and they may help you manage risks and potentially
            consolidate your returns over time.</p><br>
