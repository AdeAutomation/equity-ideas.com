        <h1>About Us</h1>

        <p>Our mission is to support school leaders and teachers in order to educate a more vibrant, stronger and more
            ardent generation of students to meet the challenges of the new rapid technologically developing age through
            STEM education. <br/>
        <p>We believe that educating all our younger generation will bring about innovative changes in the development
            of our nation both in technology and in moral conduct in the future.</p><br>
        We also operate globally reaching out to prospective students who want to study abroad. We render end to end
        services in visa assistance, travel assistance and admissions at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels
        along with tutorial services for SAT or GRE exams thus making us a one stop shop for overseas education.</p>

        <h2>What is STEM Education</h2>
        <p>STEM is an educational reform that has been in the making for years.
            It may simply be defined as the integration of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics into a new
            cross-disciplinary subject in schools.
            The study of STEM offers students the opportunity to make sense of the integrated world we live in rather
            than learning fragmented bits and pieces of knowledge and practices about it.
        </p><br/><br>

        <h2>Why STEM Education</h2>
        <p>At the college and university levels, there are major concerns that the U.S. is loosing its technology and
            engineering leadership to other countries in the world.
            The Aerospace Industries Association of America reported in 2008 that the U.S. is currently experiencing a
            chronic decline in homegrown STEM talent, and is increasingly dependent on foreign scholars to fill the
            workforce and leadership voids
            Similarly in 2007, the total number of foreign citizens studying in the U.S. (including undergraduates)
            has passed the half-million mark. Nearly one-third of all graduate students enrolled in the U.S.
            universities now come from abroad (The National Academies, 2007)
        </p><br>
        <p>Our 21st century learners need to learn the skills needed to meet the demands of today’s fast growing
            technology in today's classrooms by focusing on STEM education (Science, Technology, Engineering, and
            Math)</p>
